# Word-Guess-Game
The goal is to create a game app where the computer randomly selects a word and the player must guess what it is. 

Game Theme: Adventure Time
- The words the computer randomly selects are Adventure Time characters.
- Character's names are stored in an array and can be adjusted.
- Possible characters are: "jake", "finn", "marcaline", "bmo", and "lemongrab".

The program does the following:
1. Selects a character at random.
2. Displays character with the letters displayed as "_" until the correct letter has been guessed.
3. Tracks the guesses that are correct, remaining guesses, total guesses, and total wins.
4. Will display new word if "Next Word" button was selected. 
5. Game will continue until the player guesses 3 words correctly, uses up all 40 guesses, or player hits stop game button.
6. If user Wins the game "You Win" will be displayed and Lemongrab's mp3 audio will say "Beautiful".
7. If user Loses the game "Game Over" will be displayed and Lemongrab's mp3 audio will say "Unacceptable".
8. If "Stop Game" button is selected Lemongrab's mp3 audio will say "Unacceptable" and the page reloads to clear our word and gueses. 
9. Game will not begin until "Start Game" button has been selected.
